There are many sources that already exist, and we have been introduced to some of them like https://www.kaggle.com. It is important to identify where your data is coming from.  If you are collecting your own data, ensure you follow proper ethical practices when collecting data.  The following link may be useful if you are interested in collecting your own data https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/data-ethics."

We idenify any records with missing values, any duplicate data that might exist, and any data that might be invalid to our analysis.  We make use of charts and graphs to break down our data and better understand what we are using."

The more data you present the better the model is trained, however you do need a sufficient test set to test your model."

If we are above this range we may have an issue with the data that is being selected, or we have a very strong data correlation.  If we are below that range we may need to examine the data that we are using to decide if there is a way of fine tuning the data we provide to the algorithm to better increase the accuracy.  This could include removing outliers, removing data that is less relavent, increasing the data pool, etc."
